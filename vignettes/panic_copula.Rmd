As in [_A New Breed for Copulas for Risk and Portfolio Management_](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1752702), `panic_copula()` models the market as a mixture of calm vs. panic environments. 

The "calm" market happens most of the time, while the "panic" events are triggered endogenously for a brief period.
